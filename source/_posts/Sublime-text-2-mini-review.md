<p>I&#8217;m a TextMate user. But recently I&#8217;ve had to work in all 3 platforms at once (Main computer running Windows, with RoR running in a VM, accessed by means of a text editor+<a target="_blank" href="http://www.expandrive.com/">ExpanDrive</a> and FireFox in the Windows host. Macbook Air as an auxiliary service, watching more logs or using Sequel Pro to mess with the database. <a target="_blank" href="http://synergy-foss.org/">Synergy</a> ties the mouse &amp; keyboard together on the two physical machines.).</p>
<p>So what editor am I using if I can&#8217;t have my beautiful TextMate running at 1080p?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-2-beta">Sublime Text 2</a>, of course! It supports TextMate themes&#8230; First thing I did was install VibrantInk.tmTheme. <strong>It is native cross-platform software!</strong> No nasty Java, or worse, JRuby (*cough* redcar *cough*)</p>
<p>I love the split pane feature, which you&#8217;d come to expect after working with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tenshu.net/p/terminator.html">Terminator</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>.</p>
<p>Why are you still reading this? Go download Sublime Text 2 and if you like it, support the developers (buy a license).</p>
<p>(I have no affiliation with them, I just think the editor is awesome and I want it to continue to be improved)</p>
<p><strong>If there is one missing feature it would be a better split-pane system such as that of iTerm2, e.g. 2 panes on the left, one on the right, etc</strong></p>
