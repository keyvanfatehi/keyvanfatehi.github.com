notes:

came out great! the oven configuration and timing seemed perfect.

the chicken was boring in the middle because of no marination, also i think the breading was pretty unnecessary / hid the taste of the garlic butter.

the potatoes were pretty amazing, especially how they became crispy on the bottoms
