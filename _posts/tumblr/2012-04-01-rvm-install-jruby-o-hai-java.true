<p>In the past when creating GUI applications, I&#8217;d use Qt. However I&#8217;ve been exploring JRuby a lot more lately so I decided to try using Java&#8217;s Swing libraries for GUI programming.</p>
<p>In JRuby, everything from Java becomes available by making a single require: require &#8216;java&#8217;</p>
<p>I quickly looked for the best quality Java tutorials on the net&#8230; Caveofprogramming.com delivered and I ended up with a Ruby translation for <a href="http://www.caveofprogramming.com/java/java-swing-gridbaglayou-video-tutorial-part-4/" target="_blank">Java Swing: GridBagLayout Video Tutorial Part 4</a> </p>
