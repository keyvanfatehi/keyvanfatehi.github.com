I'm a software developer, and not an economist, but I'm beginning to feel some things that were never apparent to me and I didn't much care to think of before -- I hope it may be something I can articulate soon. But as of now, no, I can't do any better, and even if I did have clear ideas for reformation that would satisfy the internal moral conflict that the above discusses, I don't have the money/power/influence to implement the reforms it would take to make us a more innovative and forward thinking state.

I do think that open source, anonymity, and bitcoins are building blocks to a subversive arsenal against the tyrants that stifle innovation: current laws, market forces, assholes. This all reduces the rate of good positive change and the general level of beauty and art in the world.

I'll close by saying the top hedge fund managers in the world get paid inane amounts of money for doing literally nothing positive (it's a zero sum game), while the scientists trying to cure your mother's cancer are being stifled and underfunded. Sick society.
