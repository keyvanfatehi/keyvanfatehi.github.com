2:58 PM <keyvan> wooo bountysource is awesome. good job :D
2:59 PM <keyvan> my very first bounty https://www.bountysource.com/#issues/379039-portfolio-page
3:03 PM  ⇐ nbouscal quit  ↔ brooss nipped out  
3:43 PM <•corytheboyd> aww, thanks keyvan :)
3:43 PM <•corytheboyd> feel free to give us feedback!
3:44 PM <keyvan> sure thanks
3:46 PM <keyvan> corytheboyd: do you think should i be making an effort to market the opportunity or does bountysource do this for me somehow? that was one of the difficulties i had in thinking of how to design such an application... the marketing aspect...
3:47 PM → nbouscal joined (~nbouscal@c-67-185-201-65.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
3:50 PM <•corytheboyd> keyvan: good question. we don't advertise bounties outside of our site
3:51 PM <•corytheboyd> it's mostly up the the respective community to advertise bounties
3:51 PM <keyvan> corytheboyd: my other question was, how do you make money? i was debating if i'd scrape money from the bounties in my implementation but i wasnt sure how that would fly with people
3:51 PM <keyvan> what strategy are you taking on the money front?
3:54 PM <keyvan> ccverg: how did you find my issue by the way? did you search github for "bounty" or something? the fact that you guys have built this thing is such a pleasant surprise. i mean to look to see if you guys have an API later, i'll just make my browser extension ive been working on fit right into that
3:55 PM <keyvan> also it would be cool for the issue itself to get auto-updated by BountySource to say something like "There is a X bounty on this issue!" and other appropriate notices if any
3:55 PM <keyvan> ive thought a lot about this project so i'm kind of excited that it's here :)
3:56 PM ⇐ nbouscal quit (~nbouscal@c-67-185-201-65.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) Quit: Computer has commenced electric sheep tracking protocol.
3:56 PM <keyvan> i think it will have huge positive consequences -- i.e. people with skill but inability to find jobs can now do useful work and get paid... i know several people like this personally.
3:58 PM <•ccverg> kevyan: hey there!
3:59 PM <•ccverg> we charge a fee on bounties that are paid out, and on fundraisers once they are successful
4:00 PM <•ccverg> we actually have a plugin for GitHub that updates issues with bounty details as you described, but a project committer has to enable it
4:00 PM <•ccverg> you can see some screenshots on our blog (blog.bountysource.com/post/48954271533/improved-github-integration-automatically-update)
4:00 PM <keyvan> lol you guys may want to fix this http://cl.ly/image/1d09080J1Y24
4:01 PM <keyvan> nice good stuff ccverg 
4:01 PM <•ccverg> "people with skill but inability to find jobs can now do useful work and get paid... i know several people like this personally." — that's awesome! that's our goal, allowing open source developers to sustain themselves with their work
4:02 PM <•ccverg> kevyan: ack, good catch
4:02 PM <•ccverg> we'll update that, thanks
4:03 PM <keyvan> ccverg: i would love to help you guys out, from a dev perspective, like on weekends and maybe nights -- it was my ambition to build what you guys have so feel free to direct me to the proper channels if you're interested in a Ruby/Rails/Coffeescript/Javascript/iOS developer looking at stuff
4:04 PM <keyvan> like if you have an API that would be a great start so i can work on the browser extension and you guys can see if you like it / think it should be part of it or something
4:04 PM <keyvan> also i was thinking of a mobile app that is basically a browser with the ideas of the browser extension built in, so you're contributing to open source from your mobile device, making money thru bountysource integrations as well (if the project ur editing has a bounty that is)
4:07 PM <keyvan> sorry i havent checked the bountysource github page, you probably alreayd have most if not all of it open source anyway, wherein i can find issues, and browser for API docs myself -- im just at work right now :) i'll definitely be looking deeper later
4:11 PM <•ccverg> kevyan: awesome! :D
4:12 PM <•ccverg> only our frontend is open source right now, actually… but you're welcome to check out the issues we have open so far
4:12 PM <•ccverg> and we really appreciate you wanting to help out!
4:19 PM <•corytheboyd> keyvan: sorry, got a little distracted :p

4:50 PM  ⇐ nbouscal and satazor quit  ↔ jsilver popped in  
6:41 PM <keyvan> woohoo first bounty complete! https://www.bountysource.com/#issues/379039-portfolio-page
6:41 PM <keyvan> definitely a smooth process, my bounty hunter is pleased as well
7:48 PM  ↔ Anonymous296 popped in  ↔ bountysource, warreng, corytheboyd, •ccverg (opped) and realazthat nipped out  
10:19 PM <keyvan> im going to start making random projects, speccable, and giving them bounties :) there aren't enough live bounties as there should be... easy ones even
10:20 PM <keyvan> knowing there's an "army of developers" out there that can slam out any spec should motivate more of us that squelch our ideas because "work is more important" and you never write that README
10:20 PM <keyvan> maybe someone's willing to do it if you throw some coin at it!
10:23 PM <keyvan> i thought (and mostly meet this type->) people resisted sharing their ideas because they are afraid to share... they're wrong you should share, and you should even place a bounty on if it's something you really want built -- if you're in it for the money and u dont want to share for that reason, your startup probably won't do well anyway and don't get the
10:23 PM <keyvan> big picture (i dont say this to them though, i'll generally motivate them to learn jQuery or ruby).
