# It's funny, you know

I am the same keyvan you see in the [newznab hall of fame](http://newznab.readthedocs.org/en/latest/readme/#hall-of-fame), I'm known to help out occasionally in irc//synirc#newznab 

I'm the creator of the little-known app [Leechcloud](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-RvU1sHXPs) from back in 2011 (feels like a long time ago, but it isn't!)

 I love telling the story to people in the industry (It appears I work in Hollywood now) about my humble beginnings as the pirate/hacker that would call the MPAA phone number to talk about USENET, TPB, NETFLIX, and HULU. The kid who got expelled from high school and dropped out of community college. Strange.

Now I'm older and I see the same slow-moving industry, except I'm here seeing it move slowly face to face, instead of from afar.

In the past two years at my job I've actually built somewhat of a clone of Leechcloud itself, but prettier and what feels like different features to the same system... that aside, thinking more about America itself it's sad to consider how amazing Obama's ORCA was and comparing it to the VA as the technological laggards that couldn't hire a decent dev team if their life depended on it.

I can make this radical logic jump because I see that if I were taken seriously, it wouldn't have taken 4 years to have a simple cloud player built.

> It's just funny the way things work out

I wonder why I haven't found a stable, prolific development team yet. If I take a look around, it might seem there just aren't enough people around that can mold the web in the same way... but I've seen effective teams in my day, even though I'm only 24, that's still some experience.

The other day, our old rails consultancy, [MDX][http://mindynamicsgroup.com], as a cakephp app came back online without any bidding from myself. The original mindynamics site was domain-squatted immediately after I stopped paying for it.

In any case, it's interesting to see how far the 'pirate hacker' has gone, and it's delighting to see movement in the right direction at least by my own choices when it comes to technology -- that's all I can effect right now. I think money is the answer to being able to effect more change, but so far I don't think I'm playing that game right either.

It's only unfortunate that those that are laggards in the technology cannot be more forward thinking in the non-technological affairs; now it'd be a damn shame for there to be atrophy on both of those accounts.
