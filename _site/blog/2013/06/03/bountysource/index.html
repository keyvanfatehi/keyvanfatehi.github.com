      <p>pre 2:58 PM keyvan joined (uid7672@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-noobbtzvvxakpxyr) 2:58 PM Channel mode is +cnt 2:58 PM Homepage: http://www.bountysource.com 2:58 PM keyvan wooo bountysource is awesome. good job :D 2:59 PM keyvan my very first bounty https://www.bountysource.com/#issues/379039-portfolio-page 3:03 PM nbouscal quit brooss nipped out<br />3:43 PM corytheboyd aww, thanks keyvan :) 3:43 PM corytheboyd feel free to give us feedback! 3:44 PM keyvan sure thanks 3:46 PM keyvan corytheboyd: do you think should i be making an effort to market the opportunity or does bountysource do this for me somehow? that was one of the difficulties i had in thinking of how to design such an application&#8230; the marketing aspect&#8230; 3:47 PM nbouscal joined (~nbouscal@c-67-185-201-65.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) 3:50 PM corytheboyd keyvan: good question. we don&#8217;t advertise bounties outside of our site 3:51 PM corytheboyd it&#8217;s mostly up the the respective community to advertise bounties 3:51 PM keyvan corytheboyd: my other question was, how do you make money? i was debating if i&#8217;d scrape money from the bounties in my implementation but i wasnt sure how that would fly with people 3:51 PM keyvan what strategy are you taking on the money front? 3:54 PM keyvan ccverg: how did you find my issue by the way? did you search github for &#8220;bounty&#8221; or something? the fact that you guys have built this thing is such a pleasant surprise. i mean to look to see if you guys have an API later, i&#8217;ll just make my browser extension ive been working on fit right into that 3:55 PM keyvan also it would be cool for the issue itself to get auto-updated by BountySource to say something like &#8220;There is a X bounty on this issue!&#8221; and other appropriate notices if any 3:55 PM keyvan ive thought a lot about this project so i&#8217;m kind of excited that it&#8217;s here :) 3:56 PM nbouscal quit (~nbouscal@c-67-185-201-65.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) Quit: Computer has commenced electric sheep tracking protocol. 3:56 PM keyvan i think it will have huge positive consequences &#8211; i.e. people with skill but inability to find jobs can now do useful work and get paid&#8230; i know several people like this personally. 3:58 PM ccverg kevyan: hey there! 3:59 PM ccverg we charge a fee on bounties that are paid out, and on fundraisers once they are successful 4:00 PM ccverg we actually have a plugin for GitHub that updates issues with bounty details as you described, but a project committer has to enable it 4:00 PM ccverg you can see some screenshots on our blog (blog.bountysource.com/post/48954271533/improved-github-integration-automatically-update) 4:00 PM keyvan lol you guys may want to fix this http://cl.ly/image/1d09080J1Y24 4:01 PM keyvan nice good stuff ccverg 4:01 PM ccverg &#8220;people with skill but inability to find jobs can now do useful work and get paid&#8230; i know several people like this personally.&#8221; — that&#8217;s awesome! that&#8217;s our goal, allowing open source developers to sustain themselves with their work 4:02 PM ccverg kevyan: ack, good catch 4:02 PM ccverg we&#8217;ll update that, thanks 4:03 PM keyvan ccverg: i would love to help you guys out, from a dev perspective, like on weekends and maybe nights &#8211; it was my ambition to build what you guys have so feel free to direct me to the proper channels if you&#8217;re interested in a Ruby/Rails/Coffeescript/Javascript/iOS developer looking at stuff 4:04 PM keyvan like if you have an API that would be a great start so i can work on the browser extension and you guys can see if you like it / think it should be part of it or something 4:04 PM keyvan also i was thinking of a mobile app that is basically a browser with the ideas of the browser extension built in, so you&#8217;re contributing to open source from your mobile device, making money thru bountysource integrations as well (if the project ur editing has a bounty that is) 4:07 PM keyvan sorry i havent checked the bountysource github page, you probably alreayd have most if not all of it open source anyway, wherein i can find issues, and browser for API docs myself &#8211; im just at work right now :) i&#8217;ll definitely be looking deeper later 4:11 PM ccverg kevyan: awesome! :D 4:12 PM ccverg only our frontend is open source right now, actually… but you&#8217;re welcome to check out the issues we have open so far 4:12 PM ccverg and we really appreciate you wanting to help out! 4:19 PM corytheboyd keyvan: sorry, got a little distracted :p 4:25 PM nbouscal joined (~nbouscal@c-67-168-113-48.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) 4:27 PM keyvan cool for sure. np cory 4:50 PM nbouscal and satazor quit jsilver popped in<br />6:41 PM keyvan woohoo first bounty complete! https://www.bountysource.com/#issues/379039-portfolio-page 6:41 PM keyvan definitely a smooth process, my bounty hunter is pleased as well 7:48 PM Anonymous296 popped in bountysource, warreng, corytheboyd, ccverg (opped) and realazthat nipped out<br />10:19 PM keyvan im going to start making random projects, speccable, and giving them bounties :) there aren&#8217;t enough live bounties as there should be&#8230; easy ones even 10:20 PM keyvan knowing there&#8217;s an &#8220;army of developers&#8221; out there that can slam out any spec should motivate more of us that squelch our ideas because &#8220;work is more important&#8221; and you never write that README 10:20 PM keyvan maybe someone&#8217;s willing to do it if you throw some coin at it! 10:23 PM keyvan i thought (and mostly meet this type-) people resisted sharing their ideas because they are afraid to share&#8230; they&#8217;re wrong you should share, and you should even place a bounty on if it&#8217;s something you really want built &#8211; if you&#8217;re in it for the money and u dont want to share for that reason, your startup probably won&#8217;t do well anyway and don&#8217;t get the 10:23 PM keyvan big picture (i dont say this to them though, i&#8217;ll generally motivate them to learn jQuery or ruby). 10:26 PM mode: corytheboyd (opped) nbouscal popped in<br />/pre</p>
