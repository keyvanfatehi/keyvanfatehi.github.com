      <h1 id='paratrain'>PARATRAIN</h1>

<p>Paratrain is a new app I&#8217;m developing for audio, language, and animal research. It stands for something along the lines of parrot-assist training,</p>

<h2 id='artificial_intelligence'>Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<h3 id='carrot'>CARROT</h3>

<p>In Chicago last week I purchased CARROT on the Apple App Store while in line for Shedd Aquarium. Animals, ooh, I forgot all about them while developing software all the time. My legs fucking hurt too until the final Day there wherein my muscles finally remembered they can regenerate.</p>

<p>Food and drugs doesn&#8217;t fix long-term atrophy, exercise is necessary. Some people get dogs, like my older brother, which makes him more be more active.</p>

<p>One could assert by this that this is a <strong>use case</strong> for having a kid <em>oof</em> i mean pet.</p>

<p>It is a selfish reason, but a reason no less.</p>

<h3 id='paratrain'>PARATRAIN</h3>

<p>This is <a href='https://github.com/keyvanfatehi/paratrain'>my accidental AI project</a>&#8230; (the rapidly iterative README as of today)</p>

<h4 id='paratrain_readme'>Paratrain README</h4>

<h2 id='paratrain'>Paratrain</h2>

<ol>
<li>Purchase Paratrain from the Apple App Store</li>

<li>Make sure you&#8217;re connected to wifi and have a lot of battery</li>

<li>Open the app and create a profile for the learner</li>

<li>Setup some options in the the profile and enable the algorithm</li>

<li>Ensure the iphone and the learner are within earshot of each other.</li>

<li>Optionally set up a 2nd screen to provide visual data for the learner (See the API by version 1)</li>

<li>Optionally place wireless nodes around for the learner to activate. Custom-configuration possible. (See the API by version 2)</li>

<li>Optionally enable camera and the &#8220;Paratrainer&#8221; for strategies of increased awareness between learner and AI (See the API by version 3) * The paratrainer avatar can be invoked remotely by you (See facially emotive API by version 4)</li>
</ol>

<p>I don&#8217;t expect anything like Version 4 for at least another 3 years.</p>

<p>I intend to complete Version 1 by the end of June. The rest is futurestory, or as I like to call them, user stories&#8230;</p>

<h2 id='paratrain_ai_subsystems'>Paratrain AI Subsystems</h2>

<h1 id='system_1_listening_mode'>System 1 Listening Mode</h1>

<p>System 1 can be toggled on or off. It&#8217;s Paratrain&#8217;s &#8220;Listening Mode&#8221;. This is how it affects Paratrain&#8217;s behavior:</p>

<pre><code>It collect words the that it &quot;hears&quot;.
When it hears a new word, it will verify that it&#39;s a word by converting the audio to text.
  consider the confidence of the conversion
  unconfident? then forget it
  confident? then do this:
    consider whether we&#39;ve heard this word before
    we have?
      take note that we just heard this word again.
      store this unique utterance (Word has_many Utterances)
    we haven&#39;t?
      fetch media for the word (definitions, thesaurus, audio, images, video)
      store all this in the database
    Check if System 2 is enabled, if so, notify it that we&#39;ve just now heard this word [id] for the [count] time
  not sure?
    store it in the app, let the user choose to:
      * listen to the sample
      * convert it to text manually and save with that audio
      * adjust the confidence threshold</code></pre>

<p>System 1 will start to be implemented once <a href='https://github.com/keyvanfatehi/paratrain/issues/6'>#6</a> is complete.</p>

<h2 id='system_2_learning_mode'>System 2 Learning Mode</h2>

<p>Responsible for matters related to the exposure of the iphone&#8217;s existence to the learner.</p>

<h3 id='engagement'>Engagement</h3>

<p>Engagement controls if and how the iphone speaks to nearby listeners There are several aspects of engagement exposed by System 2</p>

<ul>
<li>persistence 0-100</li>

<li>aggression 0-100</li>

<li>boredom 0-100</li>

<li>rewards</li>

<li>content</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='second_screen'>Second Screen</h2>

<p>If a second screen is available (Apple TV), the <strong>Visual Association Toggle</strong> becomes available. It works like this:</p>

<h4 id='vatsystem_1'>VAT:System 1</h4>

<pre><code>As someone learning a language
When my artificial intelligence hears a word
In order that I be more likely to learn the word
I prefer an associative visual element appear onscreen</code></pre>

<h4 id='vatsystem_2'>VAT:System 2</h4>

<pre><code>As someone learning a language
When I am engaged by my artificial intelligence
In order that I be more likely to learn the word
I prefer an associative visual element appear onscreen</code></pre>
<hr />
<h1 id='goal'>Goal</h1>

<p>Design a system good enough to teach an African Grey parrot at least 500 words before the age of 6, without inflicting emotional damage.</p>

<p>If successful, it can be used for small children, and eventually turn into an effective &#8220;knowledge download&#8221; tool. Might as well dream big; but it&#8217;s mainly to distract me from immediately buying a Grey before I&#8217;m really ready.</p>

<h2 id='no_impulsebuy'>No impulse-buy</h2>

<p>Only a few days ago, my brother suggested I get a parrot. I didn&#8217;t speak or think of parrots for maybe 7 years; It was something I could just never have, and so put away mentally &#8230; too expensive &#8230; with luck, becoming a competent developer has allowed me to break that financial barrier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Resisting the impulse buy the African Grey is hard, but it&#8217;s a huge responsibility &#8211; I am older and the facts of the matters make resistance easy</p>

<p>I always wanted a parrot as a kid, but needed to wait until I knew I could take care of it correctly (and afford one). I&#8217;ve had pets that died, and as a small kid, it can be traumatic. Failing to train a Grey well would be almost criminal.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m 24 and I feel like this parrot thing is now is making me face it, and the other big questions, all at once.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a small thing for him, I think, but for me it begins to feel as though it has stirred up a great spirit that been asleep inside me. All this time I&#8217;ve been secluding myself, perhaps buried under a lot of old guilt from the pets that I&#8217;ve had that have died &#8212; not getting any more pets so as not to &#8220;kill it again&#8221;. Perhaps this is one of those latent and hard-to-understand better-to-avoid reasons I am so keen to remain single&#8230; err&#8230;</p>

<p>Uhm, in any case: I have a long history with avians and would rather get the bird when I have a house, to build a proper aviary again.</p>

<p>But I can start <a href='https://github.com/keyvanfatehi/paratrain'>developing software</a> and <a href='https://github.com/keyvanfatehi/paratrain/issues/5'>doing research</a>. It has proven fruitful so far.</p>

<p>I feel that <strong>buying the parrot right now would be a big mistake</strong></p>

<p>The matured scientist in me is eagerly awaiting pending discoveries into learning and intelligence &#8230; and wants to ensure readiness &#8230; once this turns into design, and then <em>implementation</em>, I am ready.</p>

<h1 id='caged_bird'>Caged Bird</h1>

<p>I will be waiting until the software <em>AND</em> hardware is ready. I need an indoor cage. I&#8217;m opting not to build it with wood as I did for the doves I owned as a small child (these pets created life&#8230; they are not a memory of death like some later animals I had; but one of but birth and life; contentment and prosperity)</p>

<p>Consequently, software and hardware for a parrot equates to massive amounts of learning by the undertaker <span>me</span>.</p>

<h2 id='3d_printer__solidworks__technique___habitat_'>3d Printer + Solidworks + Technique &#8230; = Habitat ?</h2>

<p>My <a href='http://pirate3d.com/'>Pirate3d 3d Printer, the Buccaneer</a>, arrives in Dec 2013.</p>

<p>Now I have a real reason to properly learn <strong>SOLIDWORKS</strong> again.</p>

<p>I need a chop-up-big-stuff algorithm for this. I am looking into <span>aluminum</span> extrusion/profile interlock systems for this.</p>

<h2 id='space_i_see_you_baby'>Space, I see you baby</h2>

<p>All I need to do now is ensure I learn electronics too and perhaps my Space 2022 ambitions will indeed become true on time.</p>

<p>If something like paratrain can be pulled off as quickly as it looks, then building the micro-agriculture systems I&#8217;ve envisioned should be less sweat too.</p>
