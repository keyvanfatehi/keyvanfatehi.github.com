      <h1>PARATRAIN</h1>

<p>Paratrain is a new app I&#39;m developing for audio, language, and animal research. It stands for something along the lines of parrot-assist training, </p>

<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<h3>CARROT</h3>

<p>In Chicago last week I purchased CARROT on the Apple App Store while in line for Shedd Aquarium. Animals, ooh, I forgot all about them while developing software all the time. My legs fucking hurt too until the final Day there wherein my muscles finally remembered they can regenerate.</p>

<p>Food and drugs doesn&#39;t fix long-term atrophy, exercise is necessary.
Some people get dogs, like my older brother, which makes him more be more active.</p>

<p>One could assert by this that this is a <strong>use case</strong> for having a kid <em>oof</em> i mean pet.</p>

<p>It is a selfish reason, but a reason no less.</p>

<h3>PARATRAIN</h3>

<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/keyvanfatehi/paratrain">my accidental AI project</a>... (the rapidly iterative README as of today)</p>

<h4>Paratrain README</h4>

<h2>Paratrain</h2>

<ol>
<li>Purchase Paratrain from the Apple App Store</li>
<li>Make sure you&#39;re connected to wifi and have a lot of battery</li>
<li>Open the app and create a profile for the learner</li>
<li>Setup some options in the the profile and enable the algorithm</li>
<li>Ensure the iphone and the learner are within earshot of each other.</li>
<li>Optionally set up a 2nd screen to provide visual data for the learner (See the API by version 1)</li>
<li>Optionally place wireless nodes around for the learner to activate. Custom-configuration possible. (See the API by version 2)</li>
<li>Optionally enable camera and the &quot;Paratrainer&quot; for strategies of increased awareness between learner and AI (See the API by version 3)

<ul>
<li>The paratrainer avatar can be invoked remotely by you (See facially emotive API by version 4)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I don&#39;t expect anything like Version 4 for at least another 3 years.</p>

<p>I intend to complete Version 1 by the end of June. The rest is futurestory, or as I like to call them, user stories...</p>

<h2>Paratrain AI Subsystems</h2>

<h1>System 1 Listening Mode</h1>

<p>System 1 can be toggled on or off. It&#39;s Paratrain&#39;s &quot;Listening Mode&quot;. This is how it affects Paratrain&#39;s behavior:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">It collect words the that it &quot;hears&quot;.
When it hears a new word, it will verify that it&#39;s a word by converting the audio to text.
  consider the confidence of the conversion
  unconfident? then forget it
  confident? then do this:
    consider whether we&#39;ve heard this word before
    we have?
      take note that we just heard this word again.
      store this unique utterance (Word has_many Utterances)
    we haven&#39;t?
      fetch media for the word (definitions, thesaurus, audio, images, video)
      store all this in the database
    Check if System 2 is enabled, if so, notify it that we&#39;ve just now heard this word [id] for the [count] time
  not sure?
    store it in the app, let the user choose to:
      * listen to the sample
      * convert it to text manually and save with that audio
      * adjust the confidence threshold
</code></pre></div>
<p>System 1 will start to be implemented once <a href="https://github.com/keyvanfatehi/paratrain/issues/6">#6</a> is complete.</p>

<h2>System 2 Learning Mode</h2>

<p>Responsible for matters related to the exposure of the iphone&#39;s existence to the learner.</p>

<h3>Engagement</h3>

<p>Engagement controls if and how the iphone speaks to nearby listeners
There are several aspects of engagement exposed by System 2
 * persistence 0-100
 * aggression 0-100
 * boredom 0-100
 * rewards
 * content</p>

<h2>Second Screen</h2>

<p>If a second screen is available (Apple TV), the <strong>Visual Association Toggle</strong> becomes available. It works like this:</p>

<h4>VAT:System 1</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">As someone learning a language
When my artificial intelligence hears a word
In order that I be more likely to learn the word
I prefer an associative visual element appear onscreen
</code></pre></div>
<h4>VAT:System 2</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">As someone learning a language
When I am engaged by my artificial intelligence
In order that I be more likely to learn the word
I prefer an associative visual element appear onscreen
</code></pre></div>

<h1>Goal</h1>

<p>Design a system good enough to teach an African Grey parrot at least 500 words before the age of 6, without inflicting emotional damage.</p>

<p>If successful, it can be used for small children, and eventually turn into an effective &quot;knowledge download&quot; tool. Might as well dream big; but it&#39;s mainly to distract me from immediately buying a Grey before I&#39;m really ready.</p>

<h2>No impulse-buy</h2>

<p>Only a few days ago, my brother suggested I get a parrot. I didn&#39;t speak or think of parrots for maybe 7 years; It was something I could just never have, and so put away mentally ... too expensive ... with luck, becoming a competent developer has allowed me to break that financial barrier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Resisting the impulse buy the African Grey is hard, but it&#39;s a huge responsibility -- I am older and the facts of the matters make resistance easy</p>

<p>I always wanted a parrot as a kid, but needed to wait until I knew I could take care of it correctly (and afford one). I&#39;ve had pets that died, and as a small kid, it can be traumatic. Failing to train a Grey well would be almost criminal.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 24 and I feel like this parrot thing is now is making me face it, and the other big questions, all at once.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a small thing for him, I think, but for me it begins to feel as though it has stirred up a great spirit that been asleep inside me. All this time I&#39;ve been secluding myself, perhaps buried under a lot of old guilt from the pets that I&#39;ve had that have died --- not getting any more pets so as not to &quot;kill it again&quot;. Perhaps this is one of those latent and hard-to-understand better-to-avoid reasons I am so keen to remain single... err...</p>

<p>Uhm, in any case: I have a long history with avians and would rather get the bird when I have a house, to build a proper aviary again.</p>

<p>But I can start <a href="https://github.com/keyvanfatehi/paratrain">developing software</a> and <a href="https://github.com/keyvanfatehi/paratrain/issues/5">doing research</a>. It has proven fruitful so far.</p>

<p>I feel that <strong>buying the parrot right now would be a big mistake</strong></p>

<p>The matured scientist in me is eagerly awaiting pending discoveries into learning and intelligence ... and wants to ensure readiness ... once this turns into design, and then <em>implementation</em>, I am ready.</p>

<h1>Caged Bird</h1>

<p>I will be waiting until the software <em>AND</em> hardware is ready. I need an indoor cage. I&#39;m opting not to build it with wood as I did for the doves I owned as a small child (these pets created life... they are not a memory of death like some later animals I had; but one of but birth and life; contentment and prosperity)</p>

<p>Consequently, software and hardware for a parrot equates to massive amounts of learning by the undertaker [me].</p>

<h2>3d Printer + Solidworks + Technique ... = Habitat ?</h2>

<p>My <a href="http://pirate3d.com/">Pirate3d 3d Printer, the Buccaneer</a>, arrives in Dec 2013.</p>

<p>Now I have a real reason to properly learn <strong>SOLIDWORKS</strong> again.</p>

<p>I need a chop-up-big-stuff algorithm for this. I am looking into [aluminum] extrusion/profile interlock systems for this.</p>

<h2>Space, I see you baby</h2>

<p>All I need to do now is ensure I learn electronics too and perhaps my Space 2022 ambitions will indeed become true on time.</p>

<p>If something like paratrain can be pulled off as quickly as it looks, then building the micro-agriculture systems I&#39;ve envisioned should be less sweat too.</p>
