      <p>At my place of employment, I&#8217;ve never had the issue of a conflict of interest &#8211; until recently when I wanted to help a through-work contact to develop a small HTML5-driven web application, essentially helping him to launch an overnight startup. It was a very targeted problem, a simple one, and well thought out and designed &#8211; the kinds of projects we love because it&#8217;s clear. The kinds of projects you can turn around in a few hours if you had a bunch of Red Bull, as it were.</p>

<p>Seemed like a no-brainer, right? Well I guess not; I had met this particular entrepreneur through the work duties of interacting with the studios and artists that use our custom software, one of the standard things I needed to do myself as I built out the software division of my then-non-software-oriented (software-dev-virgin?) company. Now I have people that do this client and support interfacing &#8211; so I don&#8217;t develop the relationship that would yield this sort of excitement and impetus unless chancily I was met with the opportunity. The odds of this are low and my emotions thank the circumstances, despite this particular one&#8217;s <a href='/blog/2013/05/14/willful-defiance'>imprisoning</a> smell.</p>

<h1 id='estimate__start'>Estimate &amp; Start!</h1>

<p>Let&#8217;s build it! That&#8217;s my attitude!</p>

<p>I estimated it would take 1-3 diligent weekends to pull it off. I would create it for him and he would go sell it to the world as he wants &#8211; I ask for nothing in return. It may seem strange to some, but I do this because I love to see people&#8217;s eyes light up as the weight is lifted from their shoulder and that energy can now be put into the business side. I prefer them to run the business instead if that&#8217;s the skill they are good at. If they become successful, great! If not, even better because the lessons are valuable. Ultimately these are human investments which I think are totally worth making. In fact this is why I&#8217;m a big proponent of <a href='http://startupweekend.org/'>Startup Weekend</a> events.</p>

<h1 id='excite__fizzle'>Excite -&gt; Fizzle</h1>

<p>The issue with this, and what took a lot of drilling from various people at work (CEO, Lawyer, HR, etc) for me to understand, is that an unavoidable, unbrainstorm-out-of-able conflict exists here:</p>

<p>I just want to build great software and help people out. In fact, I said I would do it for free! It would happen on the weekend, so I have a reason to be in Los Angeles and make a friend or two outside of work while still engaging in the things that interest me (development).</p>

<p>But the society and the laws are concerned with the fact that a usual employment contract (mine included) can own things you do outside of work hours&#8230; my company happens to be &#8220;nice&#8221; enough not to lay a claim to things unless they fall within a specific scope; this unlucky entrepreneur&#8217;s idea definitely fell within it.</p>

<h1 id='when_all_else_fails_you_do_it_yourself'>When all else fails, you do it yourself</h1>

<p>On the bright side, he was really excited to <a href='http://try.jquery.com/'>try jQuery</a> and will have his hand at building his system all by himself&#8230; I believe it can be done and it&#8217;s the very same drive that resulted in my acquisition of ruby knowledge and the rest of it. This is far more valuable than any free work some developer might do for you &#8211; I am a black box. You hate the black box, as you should, you must fear the black box, anything else is irrational.</p>

<p>However I am not an ordinary black box, but one that you cannot hate or fear for if you approach me with the interest, the dam holding back a torrent of knowledge only waits to be pulled back and for these weights to be lifted, shared. A black box is a single point of failure. We design around this in our software systems as we should with our human resources. I digress.</p>

<p>As far as this entrepreneur I could not help, I hope he continues &#8211; I hope our society doesn&#8217;t call my helping him at all a &#8220;conflict of interest,&#8221; if so I think that might be the last straw before I begin active research in making life-changes such as moving to a more exquisite part of the world.</p>

<p>This pour soul can take no more irrational stifling of the sort that prevent innovators and artists from performing their craft. The dam strains and cracks against the pressure of secrecy and not-sharing. In terms of innovators, the powerfuls prefer [even force, by way of legal and fiscal circumstance] them to take rest and abstain from their art, even in their own &#8220;private time.&#8221; In my worldview, such a notion is laughable at best, but apparently such is the world we live in.</p>

<p>All that strife has got me thinking&#8230; if you could change it <a href='/blog/2013/05/16/can-you-do-better'>could you do better?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>At least in Switzerland, you have to be very cautious about what of the things you create during your employment belongs to your employer. If you do not especially ask for the contract to include only results of your work for the company, all your private inventions and achievements not only in your field of employment can be claimed by the employer. It happened to a friend of mine that even the rights on a published book of poems were taken by his employer, another one lost the rights to a new bicycle break he invented. Both were programmers.</p>

<p>Some employers insist on 100% of your work time, including private work. They then claim that all achievements have been made during their time.</p>

<p>Rare cases I agree. And maybe its different where you live. Just read your contract very carefully.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;things you create during your employment belongs to your employer&#8221; - is this the default (i.e. with no other agreements in place) rule? In the states, that&#8217;s not the default, but it can be written into contracts and it has held up in court. – Alex Papadimoulis Oct 12 &#8216;09 at 16:46</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a little more wordy,but the standard clause boils down to this in front of the court. It is one of the things that usually are missed by people - which does not matter in most cases, but when you are successful with your startup suddenly might. – malach Oct 13 &#8216;09 at 4:34</p>
