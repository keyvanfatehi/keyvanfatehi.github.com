      <p>My company (DigitalFilm Tree) has become rather well-known and well-liked in the openstack community.</p>

<p>I was not included in the 2013 Summit, but I was given the chance to attend 2014&#8217;s Summit, which I took.</p>

<p>It has been great to witness (and participate in) some of the Juno design sessions.</p>

<p>At this point it appears to me that there are 2 main archetypes: the hacker and the bullshitter.</p>

<p>The design sessions are where you get to watch and interact with these modern hackers that make the concept of &#8220;cloud&#8221; actually a reality.</p>

<p>The non-design sessions are equally respectable (those which I attended), although in terms of archetypes, the attendees of these sessions tend to fall into a more primal category.</p>

<p>In contrast to the hackers, the innovators, you also have what I can only describe as the bullshitters, the deceivers.</p>

<p>In fact, the bullshitters have their own sets of sessions at OpenStack Summit.</p>

<p>The concepts are dumbed down to single syllable words and 4-letter acronyms for easy digestion, strung together, and combined with a sales pitch designed to satisfy the modern techno-babble pallate.</p>

<p>The hackers innovate, produce, test, and ship software and documentation and then a business process amalgamates that effort into a product, since usually the raw output (code in a repo) is generally extremely hard to use (only hackers can figure it out). It takes more hackers to deploy and ensure things run too!</p>

<p>The role of the bullshitter comes in later, when it is time for the business to sell the product despite the huge competition and thus lack of distinction.</p>

<p>The hackers that made the innovation more consumable (DevOps, Ops, Documentation writers) fall into the category of the hackers.</p>

<p>I used to view the marketers and sales people in a negative way, but at the end of the day, the bullshitters are just trying to make a living too.</p>

<p>In some ways, they are like DevOps, but for the business itself, since without sales, there is no payroll. Instead, I now realize that the bullshitters are tools of the business process that seeks to make profit off the backs of the creation-for-hire hackers that produce and tame the innovation just as much as the hackers themselves are also the tools of the same business process that seeks to make profit off the deception-for-hire skills of the bullshitter.</p>

<p>I wonder, if we lived in a society where there was no strife, and thus participation in a deception engine was not necessary for survival, what software would get made in 2014, and what the bullshitters would be creating instead of lies and manipulations?</p>
