Hey, what's up, welcome

I'm a ruby/node.js/iOS developer at DigitalFilm Tree in Los Angeles, CA

You can find me on github (they generously host this page for free) as keyvanfatehi

I also use Skype as keyvan.fatehi and frequent IRC Freenode as lovclrtxt.

In addition, my twitter is @lovclrtxt

The purpose of this blog is twofold:
* Publish technical solutions to common problems, reference any of my open-source contributions, etc
* Publish pieces that help me to cope with and make sense of the world beyond computers, as needed

TODO Organize tumblr-imported posts and new posts under category "blog" for the pieces and without "blog" for the technical stuff, or maybe some other way... Maybe I should install octopress...
